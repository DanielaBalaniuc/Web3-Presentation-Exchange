## 25 November - TurkeyDay Holiday

## 18 November - More PE, less CM
- David Chadwick- Presentation Exchange and VC data model issues
    - ambiguity around iss/issuer and other cross-representation redundancies - "Orie does both, I do only one"
    - see VC issue [#832](https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/832)
- 230 and other outstanding PRs for v2
    - mostly Daniel B
- David Chadwick - limited profile should live where? upload?
    - Jace: GH [Discussions](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange/discussions
) probably best
    - Brent: TSC is currently discussing profiles, so how this work item relates to a profile is a little TBD-- let's discuss in Discussions in the meantime (and remind us to address in future PE/CM calls!)
